# Why use classes instead of structures?
Classes and structures are somewhat the same but still, they have some differences. For example, we cannot hide data in structures which means that everything is public and can be accessed easily which is a major drawback of the structure because structures cannot be used where data security is a major concern. Another drawback of structures is that we cannot add functions in it.

# Classes
Classes are user-defined data-types and are a template for creating objects. Classes consist of variables and functions which are also called class members.

# Access Specifiers

Public Access Specifier - All the variables and functions declared under public access modifier will be available for everyone. They can be accessed both inside and outside the class. Dot (.) operator is used in the program to access public data members directly.

Private Access Specifier - All the variables and functions declared under a private access modifier can only be used inside the class. They are not permissible to be used by any object or function outside the class.

# Recap

- Bjarne Stroustrup initially named C++ language as C with classes because C++ language was almost the same as C language but they added a new concept of classes in it.
- Classes are the extension of structures in C language.
- Structures had limitations such as members are public and no methods.
- Classes have some additional features than structures such as classes that can have methods and properties.
- Classes have a feature to make class members as public and private.
- In C++ objects can be declared along with class declaration:

```
class Vehicle{
            // Class definition
} bicycle, train, car;
```

# Objects Memory Allocation in C++

The way memory is allocated to variables and functions of the class is different even though they both are from the same class. The memory is only allocated to the variables of the class when the object is created. The memory is not allocated to the variables when the class is declared. At the same time, single variables can have different values for different objects, so every object has an individual copy of all the variables of the class. But the memory is allocated to the function only once when the class is declared. So the objects donâ€™t have individual copies of functions only one copy is shared among each object.

# Arrays in Classes

Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type. An array is very helpful when multiple variables are required, instead of making multiple variables one array can be used which can store multiple values. Array stores data in sequential order.

# Static Data Members
When a static data member is created, there is only a single copy of the data member which is shared between all the objects of the class. As we have discussed in our previous lecture that if the data members are not static then every object has an individual copy of the data member and it is not shared.

# Static Methods
When a static method is created, they become independent of any object and class. Static methods can only access static data members and static methods. Static methods can only be accessed using the scope resolution operator.

# An array of Objects

An array of objects is declared the same as any other data-type array.  An array of objects consists of class objects as its elements. If the array consists of class objects it is called an array of objects.

# Passing Object as Function Argument

Objects can be passed as function arguments. This is useful when we want to assign the values of a passed object to the current object. 

# Friend Function

Friend functions are those functions that have the right to access the private data members of class even though they are not defined inside the class. It is necessary to write the prototype of the friend function. One main thing to note here is that if we have written the prototype for the friend function in the class it will not make that function a member of the class.

# Friend Classes

Friend classes are those classes that have permission to access private members of the class in which they are declared. The main thing to note here is that if the class is made friend of another class then it can access all the private members of that class.
